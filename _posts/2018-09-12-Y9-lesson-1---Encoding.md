    <td>I learnt by thinking through what could be the best / most effective way of encoding a message. We then looked at the 'Caesar code' method of encoding. This takes each letter and goes back two in the alphabet to create a weakly encrypted message that soldiers who intercepted letters wouldnâ€™t understand. We then started to look into google sheets and its capabilities, that is where we left off.</td>
